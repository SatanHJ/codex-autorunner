# CAR Discord Setup Add-On (for Agents)

Use this guide after `docs/AGENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md` when a user wants the interactive Discord bot surface.

---

## Instructions for the Agent

You are helping a user enable Discord for CAR. Keep this as an optional add-on path.

### Step 1: Confirm Discord Is the Right Add-On

Ask the user if they want:

1. **Interactive Discord bot** (this guide) - slash-command control from Discord channels.
2. **Notifications only** - one-way alerts via webhooks.

Use this guide only for the interactive Discord bot flow.

### Step 2: Check Discord Prerequisites

Verify the user has:

1. Completed base setup from `docs/AGENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md`.
2. A Discord server where they can create/manage bots.
3. Optional dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install "codex-autorunner[discord]"
# local dev checkout
pip install -e ".[discord]"
```

If they installed CAR with `pipx`, reinstall with extras:

```bash
pipx uninstall codex-autorunner
pipx install "codex-autorunner[discord]"
```

### Step 3: Create Discord App and Bot Credentials

In Discord Developer Portal:

1. Create an application.
2. Add a bot user.
3. Copy:
   - Bot Token
   - Application ID
4. Invite the bot to the server with OAuth scopes:
   - `bot`
   - `applications.commands`
5. In `OAuth2 -> URL Generator`, set Bot Permissions (permissions integer):
   - `2322563695115328`
   - Re-invite the bot after changing permissions/scope settings.

Set env vars:

```bash
export CAR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="<bot-token>"
export CAR_DISCORD_APP_ID="<application-id>"
```

### Step 4: Decide Command Registration Scope

Set command registration strategy:

1. **Development:** `guild` scope (fast propagation, recommended while iterating).
2. **Production:** `global` scope (can take longer for command changes to appear).

### Step 5: Add Minimal Discord Config

In `codex-autorunner.yml` (or repo/hub override), add:

```yaml
discord_bot:
  enabled: true
  bot_token_env: CAR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
  app_id_env: CAR_DISCORD_APP_ID
  allowed_guild_ids:
    - "123456789012345678"
  allowed_channel_ids: []
  allowed_user_ids: []
  command_registration:
    enabled: true
    scope: guild
    guild_ids:
      - "123456789012345678"
  shell:
    enabled: true
    timeout_ms: 120000
    max_output_chars: 3800
  media:
    enabled: true
    voice: true
    max_voice_bytes: 10000000
```

When `discord_bot.media.voice: true`, inbound Discord audio attachments are transcribed through the configured `voice.provider` and injected into attachment context.

### Voice Provider Setup (OpenAI vs Local Whisper / MLX Whisper)

You can run voice transcription with either OpenAI Whisper (API) or local Whisper (on-device).

OpenAI Whisper (API):

1. Set an API key env var (default key name):
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY=...`
2. Set provider:
   - `voice.provider: openai_whisper`

Local Whisper (on-device, faster-whisper):

1. Install local voice dependencies:
   - `pip install "codex-autorunner[voice-local]"`
   - macOS launchd path (`scripts/install-local-mac-hub.sh` / `scripts/safe-refresh-local-mac-hub.sh`) now installs this automatically when voice provider resolves to `local_whisper` or `mlx_whisper`.
2. Set provider:
   - `voice.provider: local_whisper`
   - or env override: `CODEX_AUTORUNNER_VOICE_PROVIDER=local_whisper`

MLX Whisper (on-device, Apple Silicon):

1. Install MLX voice dependencies:
   - `pip install "codex-autorunner[voice-mlx]"`
   - macOS launchd setup auto-selects this for new Apple Silicon installs.
2. Set provider:
   - `voice.provider: mlx_whisper`
   - or env override: `CODEX_AUTORUNNER_VOICE_PROVIDER=mlx_whisper`

Provider selection and precedence:

- Only one provider is active at runtime.
- `CODEX_AUTORUNNER_VOICE_PROVIDER` overrides `voice.provider` in config.
- It is normal to keep multiple provider blocks (for example `openai_whisper`, `local_whisper`, `mlx_whisper`) in config; only the selected provider is used.
- There is no automatic provider fallback. If the selected provider fails, transcription fails for that request.

Example config:

```yaml
voice:
  enabled: true
  provider: local_whisper # or mlx_whisper / openai_whisper
  providers:
    openai_whisper:
      api_key_env: OPENAI_API_KEY
      model: whisper-1
    local_whisper:
      model: small
      device: auto
      compute_type: default
    mlx_whisper:
      model: small
```

Allowlist behavior:
- At least one allowlist must be configured.
- Any non-empty allowlist acts as a required filter.
- Example: if both `allowed_guild_ids` and `allowed_user_ids` are set, both must match.

### Step 6: Register Commands and Verify First Run

Run:

```bash
car doctor
car discord start --path <hub_or_repo_root>
```

`car discord start` now auto-syncs Discord application commands at startup (including `/car` and `/pma`) when `discord_bot.command_registration.enabled: true`.
If command registration config is invalid (for example `scope: guild` without `guild_ids`), startup exits with an actionable error.
Use manual sync only when needed:

```bash
car discord register-commands --path <hub_or_repo_root>
```

For macOS launchd-managed installs (`scripts/install-local-mac-hub.sh` / `scripts/safe-refresh-local-mac-hub.sh`):
- Discord is auto-managed when `discord_bot.enabled: true` and both credential env vars are set.
- Auto-detection uses `discord_bot.bot_token_env` and `discord_bot.app_id_env` (defaults: `CAR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `CAR_DISCORD_APP_ID`).
- Optional overrides:
  - `ENABLE_DISCORD_BOT=auto|true|false`
  - `DISCORD_LABEL` / `DISCORD_PLIST_PATH`
  - `HEALTH_CHECK_DISCORD=auto|true|false` (safe refresh)

In an allowed Discord channel:

1. Run `/car status`.
2. Bind workspace with `/car bind path:<workspace-path>`.
3. Run flow commands:
   - `/car flow status [run_id]`
   - `/car flow runs [limit]`
   - `/car flow issue issue_ref:<issue#|url>`
   - `/car flow plan text:<plan>`
   - `/car flow resume [run_id]`
   - `/car flow stop [run_id]`
   - `/car flow recover [run_id]`
   - `/car flow archive [run_id]`
   - `/car flow reply text:<message> [run_id]`
4. In PMA mode (or unbound channel), `/car flow status` and `/car flow runs` show a hub-wide flow overview.

Note: `/car` and `/pma` responses are ephemeral (visible only to the invoking user).

If the bot replies with an authorization error, check allowlists first.

### Step 7: Discord Permission Checklist

Required or likely-needed permissions:

1. Bot present in target server.
2. `applications.commands` scope granted (for slash commands).
3. Bot can view and reply in target channels:
   - `View Channels`
   - `Send Messages`
   - `Read Message History`
   - `Send Messages in Threads` (if using threads)
4. Operator can run slash commands in that channel.

You usually do not need broad admin permissions for baseline CAR Discord usage.

## PMA (Proactive Mode Agent) Support

Discord supports PMA mode for routing PMA output to a channel, managing PMA state with slash commands, and running free-text turns from channel messages.

### Enabling PMA Mode

In any allowlisted Discord channel:

1. Run `/pma on` to enable PMA mode for the channel.
2. If the channel was previously bound to a workspace, that binding is saved and restored when PMA is disabled.
3. PMA output from the agent will be delivered to the channel.

### How to Actually Chat With an Agent Today

Telegram-style back-and-forth is now supported in Discord.

For repo/workspace mode:

1. Run `/car bind path:<workspace-path>`.
2. Optional: set agent/model with `/car agent ...` and `/car model ...`.
3. Send a normal channel message (do not start with `/`).
4. The bot runs a turn and replies in-channel (non-ephemeral).

For PMA mode:

1. Run `/pma on`.
2. Send a normal channel message (do not start with `/`).
3. The bot runs a PMA turn and replies in-channel.
4. Run `/pma off` to return to the previous workspace binding.

Notes:
- Slash command responses remain ephemeral.
- In PMA mode, `/car flow status` and `/car flow runs` report hub-wide flow status (manifest-driven) without requiring `/pma off`.
- If a ticket flow run is paused in repo mode, the next free-text message is treated as the flow reply and resumes that run.
- `/car ...` and `/pma ...` slash commands are normalized through CAR's shared command-ingress parser before dispatch.
- Direct-chat turns use the shared plain-text turn policy in `always` mode, so non-command messages trigger turns while slash commands stay command-only.
- `!<cmd>` runs a local non-interactive shell command in the bound workspace when `discord_bot.shell.enabled` is `true`.

### PMA Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/pma on` | Enable PMA mode for this channel |
| `/pma off` | Disable PMA mode and restore previous binding |
| `/pma status` | Show current PMA mode status |

### PMA Prerequisites

1. PMA must be enabled in hub config (`pma.enabled: true`).
2. The user must be authorized via allowlists.

### Disabling PMA in Discord

If PMA is disabled globally in hub config, `/pma` commands will return an actionable error message indicating how to enable it.

## Troubleshooting

### Slash commands do not appear

1. Restart the Discord bot so startup auto-sync runs.
2. Re-run `car discord register-commands --path <hub_or_repo_root>` if you need to force an immediate sync.
3. For development, prefer `guild` scope with explicit `guild_ids`.
4. Verify `CAR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and `CAR_DISCORD_APP_ID` are set in the process environment.
5. If using launchd on macOS, confirm the Discord agent is loaded:
   - `launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/com.codex.autorunner.discord"`

### "Not authorized" responses

1. Check allowlists in `discord_bot`:
   - `allowed_guild_ids`
   - `allowed_channel_ids`
   - `allowed_user_ids`
2. Remember all non-empty allowlists must match the interaction.

### Bot running but no useful flow output

1. Ensure the channel is bound:
   - `/car bind path:<workspace-path>`
2. Confirm workspace path exists on the CAR host.
3. Run `car doctor` and check Discord check results for missing deps/env/state file issues.

### Slash commands work, but normal messages get no response

This usually means Discord command registration is fine, but the bot user cannot actually access guild/channel message events.

1. Re-invite the bot with both scopes:
   - `bot`
   - `applications.commands`
2. Use permissions integer:
   - `2322563695115328`
3. Confirm channel overrides do not deny:
   - `View Channels`
   - `Send Messages`
   - `Read Message History`
4. Restart Discord bot process after re-invite/permission changes.
5. Re-test with:
   - `/car status` (slash path)
   - plain text message (non-slash turn path)

High-signal diagnostics for this failure mode:
- REST responses like `Missing Access (50001)` for channel lookups.
- REST responses like `Unknown Guild (10004)` for expected guild IDs.
